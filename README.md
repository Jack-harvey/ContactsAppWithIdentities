# ContactsAppWithIdentities

This project is being used to learn all about asp.net6, html, css, js and all the bits inbetween.

This is a contacts application.
A user will log in and create a contact (name, number, e-mail, etc), they can only see their contacts and may do with them as the please.
They can export those contacts to a Vcard and import those contacts into a Vcard.
